                It was a team-project. We have created the video as an outcome for this project. <br> Our project
                depended
                on a survey so I took the responsibility to achieve our goal by <br> researching and editing the
                video. <br>

                In the time period of between 24 November to 24 December, me and my team spread the<br> message all over
                the school campus that we are initiating such a project where we will collect<br> the old clothes from
                everyone which is not useful anymore, so that we can distribute it to the poor<br> people who live in
                streets
                and does not have any clothes to protect themselves from the cold. <br>After collecting the clothes we
                then set the clothes in order so that it is easy to identify the clothes<br> which are for children,
                adults and old people. After sorting the clothes in order we then distributed it<br> to the poor people
                by searching for them on railways, streets, corners etc.<br><br>
                To spread awareness we created a YouTube Video with the title "Hate Poverty, not the Poor" <br>where we
                focused on few Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) too.<br>
